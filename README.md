# HMM-Based-POS-Tagger
Used Vanilla Veterbi Model to tag POS's and providing a solution to make the machine learn handling unknown words. 
In the First 2 Tests, we can see for example Twitter , Google and a few more got incorrectly tagged in the initial Virerbi Model but got corrected when we used the new_Viterbi 
model or the Trigram Viterbi modified model.
The third test however got correctly tagged on both the models which when given the accuracy says initial Viterbi had 90% accuracy makes sense.
